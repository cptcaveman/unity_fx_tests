# unity_fx_tests
Some quick fx tests in Unity to see if I am any good at it.

Texture Combiner Tool
  - Combines the r channel from 4 input textures into one texture
  - These textures are then used for shader effects
  - Made this so I could rapidly iterate and create different effects textures without having to open up photoshop and do it
  - Now I can just make separate grayscale textures and combine them however I went within Unity
